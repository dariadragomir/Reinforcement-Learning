# Reinforcement-Learning

This project focuses on the comparative analysis of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms within the Atari 2600 environment (via Gymnasium). Serving as a baseline for research, this repository implements and evaluates Value-Based and Policy-Based methods to solve classic discrete control tasks.

The project highlights the evolution from standard implementation to hyperparameter tuning, analyzing stability, convergence, and sample efficiency.
